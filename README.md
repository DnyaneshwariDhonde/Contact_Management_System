# Contact_Management_System

Complete and submit my Contact Management System project for the Prodigy Infotech Internship! 

This Python script is a simple yet efficient Contact Management System that enables users to add and view contacts. Contacts are stored in a JSON file (contacts.json), ensuring data persistence across multiple program runs. The system provides seamless functionality to manage contacts through intuitive options.
This project helped me enhance my Python programming skills, especially in file handling, data management, and user interaction. Looking forward to learning and building more exciting projects!
